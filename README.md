# vigilant

  Simple command-line tool to contain and run multiple processes. Each process's stdio and stderr will be combined in beautiful technicolor. Vigilant will exit after the last process has exited.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g vigilant

## Usage

```
  Usage: vigilant [options] [commands]

  Options:

    -h, --help           output usage information
    -V, --version        output the version number
    -c, --config <file>  vigilant.json config pathname (default ./vigilant.json)
```

Note: Vigilant will run all commands if none are specified.

## Silly Example

Run:
``` sh
vigilant 'date +"%y-%m-%d"' 'ls -a' 'du -d 1'
```

Produces:
```
  vigilant: 'date' running...
  vigilant: 'ls' running...
  vigilant: 'du' running...
      date: 13-11-08
        ls: .
        ls: ..
        ls: README.md
        ls: print-args.js
  vigilant: 'date' exited with 0
        du: 16  .
  vigilant: 'ls' exited with 0
  vigilant: 'du' exited with 0
```

Equivalently, create the `vigilant.json` file:

``` json
{
  "date": "date +\"%y-%m-%d\"",
  "ls": "ls -a",
  "du": "du -d 1"
}
```

And just run `vigilant` where the `vigilant.json` resides.

## Useful Example

See the [example](./example) directory

Install some useful CLIs

`npm install -g coffee-script jade stylus serve`

Make a `vigilant.json`

``` json
{
  "coffee": "coffee -w -l -j build/app.js -c src/scripts",
  "jade": "jade -w -P src/views/ -O build/",
  "stylus": "stylus -w src/styles/ -o build/",
  "serve": "serve -p 8888 build/"
}
```

Run `vigilant`

```
  vigilant: 'coffee' running...
  vigilant: 'jade' running...
  vigilant: 'stylus' running...
  vigilant: 'serve' running...
      jade: 
      jade:   rendered build/index.html
    coffee: path.exists is now called `fs.exists`.
    coffee: 
    coffee: 16:37:12 - compiled build/app.js
    stylus:   watching /usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/stylus/lib/functions/index.styl
    stylus:   compiled build/app.css
    stylus:   watching src/styles/app.styl
     serve: serving /***/vigilant/example/build on port 8888
```

Vigilant is now watching and compiling all your HTML, CSS, JS and serving the result on port 8888
